So this chain of prompts aims to provide a thorough auto-coaching journey for you in the start of a new year. You’ll unearth deeper psychological insights, map out competencies, explore bold future scenarios, and converge on a holistic, actionable strategy for robust self-actualization in life, profession or business during 2025.

Meta-instruction:
* The framework can be applied across different professions and personal goals — tailor the details to evolving contexts or new data.
* I used a blend of psychological profiling, strategic HR insights, and scenario-based foresight to guide self-actualization. Each prompt escalates complexity and breadth.
* Each prompt to build on the previous one, forming a logical progression from deep psychological profiling to competency analysis, scenario planning, and real-world application.
* To use these 6 prompts you’ll need first to gather and structure information about yourself (4 documents) – it will take 2-5 hours I guess. 


So here we go… 

--- 
## STEP #1 
Collect and structure information about yourself using AI by creating 4 documents: \
1. Your psychological profile 
2. Your socio-demographic profile 
3. Your info-profile – is a profile of your goals (personal and professional), skills, knowledge, all your resources and opportunities. 
4. A summary description of the key events of your past, starting from early childhood.

### How to do it?

**Option 1**: If you have accumulated a large history of chats in which you have discussed various aspects of your life with AI, then simply ask gpt-4o to sequentially compile 4 specified documents based on everything he knows about you. Keep in mind that you will still have to re-read, correct, and add what the AI doesn't know about you.

**Option 2**: If you have a short chat history, ask GPT-4o to compile a list of questions for you on each document so that you can answer them to him, and he can create 4 specified documents.

## STEP #2

For the best result use GPT-o1 or similar model. Use each prompt from the chain below sequentially, inserting into brackets [] the information that is indicated there.

### Prompt 1: Multifactorial psychological profile

```
Below, I provide the text of four documents compiled by GPT-4o and later corrected by me:
1. My psychological profile
2. My socio-demographic profile
3. An information questionnaire about me
4. My personal timeline

**The text:** [insert the whole text from the 4 docs above]

**Your task:** Create a deeper, higher-quality, and more multifactorial psychological profile that goes beyond what is presented. Emphasize insights I may not fully realize or that I’m unconsciously displacing. Aim for high density of thought—no fluff. Incorporate all context from the four documents. Use their content as a baseline, but expand on it to reveal deeper layers of my psyche.
```

### Prompt 2: Comprehensive competency model

```
Now, generate a comprehensive model of my competencies, both explicit and implicit. Envision yourself as an elite HR specialist and high-level profiler. Use all available information from the previous step, identifying specific skills, nuanced strengths, and hidden capabilities.»
```

### Prompt 3: Fifteen future trajectories

```
Based on everything you know about me from the previous prompts (including the textual data and analyses), propose 15 distinct trajectories for my further socio-professional and personal self-actualization. These trajectories should blend my interests in [insert you interests or valuable areas of life: sport, science, education, career and etc.] or any ambitious cross-context path you perceive. For each of the 15 trajectories:

1. Name the trajectory.
2. State the immediate (first) important task, from your perspective.
3. Estimate the approximate income after 1 year.
4. Estimate the approximate income after 3 years.
5. Each scenario must be unique and mutually distinct from the other 14.
```

### Prompt 4: Three-year integrated plan
```
I’ve briefly reviewed and commented on each of the 15 future scenarios you proposed — some I find interesting, others less so, or I might do them later: [insert all your comments].

Taking into account all my comments and the broader conversation, craft a three-year plan for my self-actualization. This plan should strategically combine the most feasible elements from the 15 scenarios invented by you. It’s not necessary to cram everything into three years; focus on the best synergy of goals that maximizes overall progress within that timeframe.

Ensure each task or goal in this plan can reinforce multiple other goals — aim for the richest contextual ‘cross-pollination’. For instance, writing a scientific paper could also become a blog post, or hosting a open training session could help me land B2B clients. I trust you can devise even more ingenious overlaps to accelerate progress on multiple fronts with each action.
```

### Prompt 5: Recommendations for your psychotherapist
```
Excellent work. Now, based on everything you have learned about me — my personal details, history, and self-assessment — please write therapeutic recommendations for my current psychotherapist. Provide suggestions on how best to work with me, drawing on my personality, experiences, and therapeutic history. 

Consider the therapist’s chosen modality and tools: [insert info about your therapist].

Also consider my experience in therapy: [insert info about your experience]

The goal is to offer strategic insights into helping me make progress without fundamentally altering my essence.
```

### Prompt 6: Strategy for 2025 (first 3 months in detail)
```
Thank you for everything so far. Something has changed in my life and there is new information: [Insert all relevant information about events that have recently affected you or are likely to affect you in the nearest future: potential job loss, changes in cryptocurrency exchange rates, birth of a child, or any other current shifts].

With this new developments, please build for me a strategic roadmap for 2025. Detail the next three months week by week, specifying goals, tasks, and milestones. For the remaining months of 2025, outline the plan in broader strokes.

Include:
1. Key steps to quickly establish new income sources.
2. Tasks for scaling my self-actualization and overall earnings.
3. Personal and professional development goals, including any required skill acquisition that complements the larger strategy.

Ensure each proposed action can serve multiple objectives where possible, leveraging synergistic opportunities (e.g., turning research into blog content, training sessions that attract clients, etc.).

The starting date of the plan should be [insert your tomorrow’s date].
